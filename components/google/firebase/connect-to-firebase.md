Here, you will see a interface like shown above. You can open a existing project(except the demo one), or create a new project by clicking `Create a project`.
After that, click on the Add App button, and select Android from there. Then, you will need to enter the package name of your project(you can find it in Sketchware Pro).
It is written here:
