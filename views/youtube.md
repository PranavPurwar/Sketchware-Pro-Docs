## When to use YouTube player
Sometimes you need to show a YouTube video in your app. For example, a new user has registered and they don't know how to use your app. You can make a YouTube video on it and show to users without letting them leave your app.
## Get Started
First off, you will need to choose a YouTube video that you want to display.
Find the video and copy its sharing URL.
Then the whole URL is not needed. You need the video's ID. To get it, follow these instructions:
Get the url, and remove https://youtu.be/ from it.
For example, a video URL is https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ then the ID of this video would be `dQw4w9WgXcQ`

Now you are done with this part.
## Implementation
 Now its time for implementation.
 
1. First, you will probably need to add a YouTube player in the activity.
